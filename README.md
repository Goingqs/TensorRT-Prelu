# TensorRT-Prelu
This code is sample to implement PReLU and Slice layer.

The code has been tested by myself, it can help you learn about TensorRT API fast!

## requirmets:
*1.TensorRT 4.0.1

*2.Cuda8.0 / Cuda9.0 and Cudnn 7.1

*3.OpenCV

## about TensorRT PReLU layer
PReLU layer has been supported officially, but it is Leaky ReLU layer actually!!!
